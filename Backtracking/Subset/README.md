Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.

 Note:
Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
Also, the subsets should be sorted in ascending ( lexicographic ) order.
The list is not necessarily sorted.
Example :

If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:

[
  [],
  [1],
  [1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [1, 3],
  [2],
  [2, 3],
  [3],
]
