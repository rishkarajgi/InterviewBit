Reverse bits of an 32 bit unsigned integer

Example 1:

x = 0,

          00000000000000000000000000000000  
=>        00000000000000000000000000000000
return 0

Example 2:

x = 3,

          00000000000000000000000000000011 
=>        11000000000000000000000000000000
return 3221225472

Since java does not have unsigned int, use long
