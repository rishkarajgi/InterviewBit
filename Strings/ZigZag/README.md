The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P.......A........H.......N
..A..P....L....S....I...I....G
....Y.........I........R
And then read line by line: PAHNAPLSIIGYIR
Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
**Example 2 : **
ABCD, 2 can be written as

A....C
...B....D
and hence the answer would be ACBD.
